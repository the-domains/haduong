Master of Science student majoring in Industrial Engineering and Management with a focus on Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship. 

I have acquired professional experiences in Online Marketing & Business Development for Startups and in the Corporate Venture Capital business. Being enthusiastic about innovation and technology, I facilitate local startup environments and I regularly write on Startup Grind & Medium.

Friends and co-workers see me as a positive and energetic person who loves to be in contact with people. I work proactively and results-driven. Following my internal drive and commitment, I am greatly determined to become an entrepreneur in the long-term.
Please reach out and connect with me. I am broadly interested and always look for exciting opportunities.
